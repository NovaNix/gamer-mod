# Gamer Mod
I was playing through the new Minecraft update, and started thinking about some of the things I wish were in the game. 

Since my programming ability has improved (and because I was interesting in how Minecraft mods are made), I decided I'd try making a mod.

This mod contains things I wish were in the game, things I think are cool, and some inside jokes between my friends.
